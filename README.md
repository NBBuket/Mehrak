# Mehrak Chatbot
Disclaimer:
This project does not have artificial intelligence or NLP.

Inspired by a video game characters sentient suitcase, Mehrak Chatbot created by fatmanurbas and NBBuket for our friend Arzu.
There are 2 buttons on the home page to access old and new chats. On the "New Chats" page you can talk to Mehrak and receive 9 different text and 30 different image replies. 
The button on the bottom left allows you to save messages in a predefined folder and view them on the "Old Chats" page.

Important Notes:
- Chats should only be saved in the <Documents/Chat With Mehrak> folder in order for the program to read and visualize them.
- Only txt files can be read.
- To get image responses, one should text some video game character names that Mehrak knows. (For example his owner Kaveh etc.)
- Only exception to last rule is Zhongli(Morax), the favorite of our friend for whom we did the project as a gift.

Special thanks to:
- My friend Thetis606 for application icon drawing
- An internet stranger agreentejada for resizable label and usercontrol code (https://github.com/agreentejada/winforms-chat)
- Myself for drawing the chat pages' background image lol
